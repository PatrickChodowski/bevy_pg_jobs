# Bevy PG Jobs

Run list of components on an entity in a sequence. 

## How it works

0) Define and add job to `Res<Jobs>` resource. Internally it uses bevy_pg_calendar to check if the job can be triggered
1) It triggers job on 
    - Cron schedule
    - RealDelay (real time seconds)
    - Delay (calendar delay in hours)
    - Instant (starts immediately)
    - OnDemand  (its in resource but it can be triggered by another system only)
2) job.start will create new empty entity with only one component - component from the first task (I assume it is SpawnTask)
3) You should define the system that would handle SpawnTask. After the task its done the SpawnTask should be removed from the entity using commands. Then call jobs.next_task to insert new component for the entity to start the new task.
4) Example tasks implemented (Variants of TaskType enum)
    - Spawn
    - Despawn
    - Hide
    - Show
    - Teleport
    - Move
    - Rotate
    - Wait
    - Decision Task 
    - Loop Task
    - Extension tasks

5) Decision tasks will make a decision and switch to some other task
6) Loop tasks will loop over tasks from the start_index to itself
7) If the loop task doesnt have maxk specified then it needs some DecisionTask at the end of iteration to get out of the loop
8) Extension task like for example: MoveToX, will first have a component for finding X, and in the system would create the move component. After search we simply delete component FindX, but insert the move component instead.
